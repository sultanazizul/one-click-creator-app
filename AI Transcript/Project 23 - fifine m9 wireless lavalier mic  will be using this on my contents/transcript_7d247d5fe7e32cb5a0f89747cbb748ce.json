    "transcript": "This is the FIFI-NM9 wireless lavelier microphone perfect for conning craters and streamers. It is a premium microphone kit which includes two mics and one receiver and comes with this charging case. You can connect it to your phone, iPhone or Android, iPad or tablet and even on your camera. Its full charge can last for seven hours of continuous reporting. I'll show you how effective the noise canceling is plus the clear and crisp transmission N3, 2. This is my voice with a FIFI-NM9 wireless lavelier mic. For context, I have my ECON, my electric panel that's just super near me and a bunch of external noises outside and inside the room. This is my voice without the mic. Just using my phone mic. Right? What do you think?",
