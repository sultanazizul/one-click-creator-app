    "transcript": "I just found out that those viral product videos we usually see on TikTok and Instagram are all made by AI. Especially the ones of influencers talking about a particular product. Hey boss media fam, just hand me the product and I'll do the rest. I'll talk, I'll convince, and I'll sell all on autopilot. You just focus on growing your business. Let me show you how they do it. No camera, no voiceover, no hiring anyone. Here's how it works. First go to pipit.cappcut.com and once you are logged in, tap on avatar video. You'll see a bunch of avatars, some in cars, some in kitchens, others chilling in bedrooms. They look crazy real which makes them perfect for ads or product promos. Pick the one you like, hit edit script, paste in your text, and pick a caption style. And you're basically done. Then hit export and your video is ready to post. No filming, no talking, all AI. If you want to try it, just comment pipit AI and I'll send you the link.",
