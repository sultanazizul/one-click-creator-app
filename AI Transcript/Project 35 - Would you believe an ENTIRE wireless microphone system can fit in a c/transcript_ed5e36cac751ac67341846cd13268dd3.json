    "transcript": "While this might be average sized to most people, this tiny little case actually holds an entire microphone system and it's actually pretty good too. Now this is the GoLiDocs Cube SC and it's a wireless microphone system for your iPhone or any mobile device. And for its size, it still records a 24 bit audio with a range of 300 meters. And while that might be impressive to most, it's a size that really matters me because well, it's literally the size of my finger tip. Now this is what regular audio sounds like coming from the GoLiDocs Cube SC and with noise cancellation turned on. This is how it sounds like with noise filtered out, although there's not much noise in here besides my whole 3D printer going off on the side there.",
