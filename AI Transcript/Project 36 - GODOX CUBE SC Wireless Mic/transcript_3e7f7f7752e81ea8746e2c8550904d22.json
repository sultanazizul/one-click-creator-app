    "transcript": "This is the Godox Cube SC, a wireless mic to attach anywhere. It comes with a USB-C dongle so that you can get great audio from your phone to help with running gun type of filming or live streaming. Click the button on board twice to start recording and once to reduce surrounding noise. And with the app you can change volume settings and more. The Godox Cube SC is a 2.4GHz wireless mic system that is just very easy to use as it is just plug and play. You get 24bit audio up to 300m of stable transmission range, 30 hours of battery life and Apple find my support. And the whole video was shot with the Godox SC mic. So if you want to know more about the Godox Cube SC then go check out the link in my bio.",
