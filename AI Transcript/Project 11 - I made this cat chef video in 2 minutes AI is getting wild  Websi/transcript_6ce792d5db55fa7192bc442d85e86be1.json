    "transcript": "Here is how to create this trendy cooking cap video in under in kisekans. First go to name that video. Inside you'll see a bunch of AI videos made by users like cooking cats, mini workers and ancient time POVs. If you click on one, you'll even see the prompt they used to create it. But in this video, I'll show you how to make one from scratch. Click create, change the aspect ratio to 916 and make sure the model is flux row. Now type your prompt. Just describe what your cat looks like, what it's doing and where it's happening. You can add more details if you want or just click rewrite to expand and improve your prompt. Edit it however you like and once you're happy, click generate. You'll get something like this. Click the generated image, then choose image to video. Adjust the prompt if needed, but for me this is already good to go. And set the model to clean standard. Click generate again and here's the final video. Here are some of the clips I generated as well. You can also easily add sound effects with just a few flicks. So easy right? If you're interested, check the link in the description below. See you in the next one.",
